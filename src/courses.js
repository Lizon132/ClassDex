The goal of the course is not to train you to become an accountant.  Rather, the course should equip you to become an informed user of financial statement information.  Because annual reports are somewhat formidable, we will study how firms present the information for various accounts in their financial statements, including the footnotes.  By the end of the course, you should have a basic understanding of financial statements and the ability to use them for decision making.  Fulfillment of these objectives involves acquiring several skills.  The course will emphasize (i) gaining familiarity with the types of transaction firms engage in, (ii) the mapping of transactions into accounting numbers, (iii) understanding the accounting-related choices that managers have for transactions and the rationale behind the various methods, (iv) developing fluency in accounting terminology, and (v) appreciating the complexity of accounting due to the (often considerable) discretion and judgment involved in choosing among alternative accounting methods, making estimates, and disclosing information in financial statements.",

How do egg yolks turn into paint on a canvas? What are the optics of pigment and perception? What are the composite properties present in creating hand-made paper? Students will formulate such questions about art in the context of the natural world, and foster an appreciation for the discoveries at the interface of art and science. \nIn this course, students will apply learned science principles in a variety of hands-on studio sessions, experiment with creating art through the mechanics of differing mediums, and discuss the ways in which science and art fields supplement and affect one another in a larger societal context. The class will be an approachable way for artists to engage in creative scientific discussions around materials used in the artistic process and for scientists to appreciate theories applied within the arts and aesthetics. Students will leave this course having developed a greater appreciation for art, materials science, and creative expression — preparing them to become multifaceted innovators of the future.\"",

While communities biologically denote the interaction of organisms sharing an environment, we will examine the practices of power that states wield toward the maximization of “life.” Hence the questions of biopower, health politics, eugenics, sexism, racism, and genocide. How do films negotiate the precarious politics of communal life, what are their strategies for resistance, and what their moments of complicity? We will explore how film reflects communal life in twentieth-century German history, but also, and perhaps primarily, how film responds to that history by generating its own speaking power and mobilizing its own political force.

    "description" : "\"Beginnings\" is a course about the emergence and development of English literature. It is a backgrounds class for majors and non-majors who are interested in reading, and/or in creative writing, and who want to understand the literary past and how it remains with us. You will leave the class with 1) a clear and informed grasp of the major authors, texts, and literary movements from the Middle Ages through the British Enlightenment, 2) some answers to why we should still care about these \"early\" authors and their writing now, and 3) sharpened skills in reading and appreciating poetry and literary forms generally. Our class will approach our literary past with openness and curiosity for what it might hold for us, remembering that we can’t find our voices without knowing something about the traditions, legacies, and heritages that precede and shape us. (This class fulfills the pre-1800 requirement for the English major as well as Humanities distribution.)",

    "description" : "An introduction to concepts, principles, and approaches of functional programming. Functional programming is a style of programming where the key means of computation is the application of functions to arguments (which themselves might be functions). This style of programming has become increasingly popular in recent years because it offers important advantages in designing, maintaining, and reasoning about programs in many modern contexts such as web services, multicore programming, and cluster computing. Course work consists of a series of programming assignments in the Scala programming language and various library extensions such as Apache Spark. Cross-list: COMP 544.

Drawing on domestic and foreign case studies from the private, public, and social sectors in domains reaching well beyond K-12 education, but always coming back to that sphere, students evaluate and apply a number of models for how institutions define objectives and measure success, produce and deploy knowledge, govern internal operations, supervise dispersed street-level staffs, and make themselves accountable to key stakeholders and the public at large. Students explore a number of tools modem organizations use for these purposes, including design thinking, quantitative analysis, qualitative evaluation, balanced scorecards, team-based problem-solving structures, and cooperative \"regimes\" of public and private actors.",

Quantitative management means trading on signals that can be constructed and tested on large panels of stocks. Many different data sources are used to generate trading signals. In this course, we illustrate concepts using predictors formed from corporate fundamentals, past prices, analyst forecasts, and earnings surprises. We discuss the full process of quantitative management, from preliminary analysis of signals to training models to backtesting and strategy assessment.",

    "description" : "BIOS 353 is a one-semester course that surveys a representative group of bacterial and viral infectious diseases and the medical countermeasures used to defeat them or in some cases just keep them in check. The course begins with a brief history of how infectious diseases have shaped human history and progresses to present day challenges including emerging pathogens both natural and man-made. We will do deep dives of several important pandemic diseases to understand their epidemiological contexts, pathogenesis and disease states. We will then examine how vaccines, antiviral and antimicrobial strategies work to protect human health at the molecular level. Importantly, we will then examine how molecular evolution provides adaptation to various biomedical interventions and why the fight against infectious diseases cannot be easily won.

It does so by focusing on how a key concept, the Anthropocene, has journeyed from the geological sciences to a wide array of disciplines and audiences. We’ll explore how historians, critics, philosophers, journalists, scientists, activists, poets, novelists, filmmakers, and others are finding new ways to talk about how we got here and how we might contend with the possible futures that await us. We’ll hone new skills for reading, writing, and thinking about changing environments. And together we’ll imagine the kind of communities we might create in response to a warming world.",

This has opened the way for myriad industries and sectors to try to develop their own best practices. Especially since the COVID pandemic, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other computational technologies have grown rapidly during the past couple of years. However, not everyone knows which, how, when, or why to implement these techniques. Many engineers, for example, oversee or work with daily streams of data and want to use them in the most efficient way possible. The main objective of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to statistical and computational methods for modern data problems faced by engineers and engineering managers. By using statistical frameworks and data science as main drivers, the student will survey and compare algorithms for various data applications, learning how to select the most suitable according to real life scenarios.\n\nIn order to enroll in an online section of this course, you are expected to have a working camera and microphone.  During class sessions, you must be able to participate using your microphone and you are expected to have your camera on for the duration of the class so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class, just as you would be in an in person class.",

It also sheds light on particular social and cultural phenomena: the role of women in society; changing notions of gender roles; class formation and relations; and cultural expressions through art, literature and new modes and spaces of sociability.",

We will do deep dives of several important pandemic diseases to understand their epidemiological contexts, pathogenesis and disease states. We will then examine how vaccines, antiviral and antimicrobial strategies work to protect human health at the molecular level. Importantly, we will then examine how molecular evolution provides adaptation to various biomedical interventions and why the fight against infectious diseases cannot be easily won.

From insurance fraud  to deviate sexual activity, Legal Interpretation delves deep into the influence and ramifications that the laws found within the codified body of both Federal & state statutes - the Penal Codes - and the various SCOTUS cases we have had over the past 80 years. Students will apply this knowledge and their own moral beliefs to ultimately answer the question: how should our personal ethical codes intersect with our interpretation of the law?",

Among the complex skills students acquire are working effectively in interdisciplinary professional teams, managing projects to specified outcomes, adaptable problem solving in the face of ambiguous and changing organizational needs, formulating team-based solutions for multi-dimensional problems (legal, operational, etc.), and designing practical analytic approaches to evaluating solutions including developing and testing hypotheses.  Students then apply these skills directly in a consulting experience. Students, working in multi-disciplinary teams, support education organizations in thinking through some of their most challenging legal, policy, strategic, design, governance, and implementation issues and provide actionable solutions. While providing client organizations with important short-term support and long-term access to exceptional professional talent, the projects give students rich opportunities to test concepts encountered in the class; unique insight into what a career in public-education leadership looks like; and important career-entry opportunities and a valuable network in the education sector.",

Today, robots are built for applications as diverse as exploring remote planets, de-mining war zones, cleaning toxic waste, assembling cars, inspecting pipes in industrial plants and mowing lawns. Robots are also interacting with humans in a variety of ways: robots are museum guides, robots assist surgeon sin life threatening operations, and robotic cars can drive us around. The field of robotics studies not only the design of new mechanisms but also the development of artificial intelligence frameworks to make these mechanism useful in the physical world, integrating computer science, engineering, mathematics and more recently biology and sociology, in a unique way. This class will present fundamental algorithmic advances that enable today’s robots to move in real environments and plan their actions. It will also explore fundamentals of the field of Artificial Intelligence through the prism of robotics. The class involves a significant programming project.

These include theoretical computer science (TCS), numerical linear algebra (NLA), statistics, applied mathematics, data analysis, machine learning, etc. As a consequence of the multi-disciplinarity of the area, researchers often fail to appreciate the underlying connections and the significance of contributions developed outside their own area.\n\nIn this course, rather than focusing on technical details, we will focus on highlighting for a broad, basic linear-algebra-savvy audience, the simplicity and generality of some core linear algebraic ideas. In particular, we will focus on two fundamental and much used matrix problems which have been at the center of recent developments: (1) Least Squares approximation and (2) Low-Rank Matrix Approximation. A key tool for achieving this goal are randomized algorithms which originated in TCS. Cross-list: ELEC 406.",

Readings will include primary legal and philosophical texts. We will read what some of the greatest minds in the Western political tradition—particularly the Anglo-American tradition—have thought about the natural condition of man, the justification for a state, the rule of law, the concept of a constitution, and the structure of the institutions and laws of the state to achieve the ends of justice and the common good.  We will begin with the foundations of political, constitutional, and legal philosophy in Plato and Aristotle.  We will then study the foundations of the common law system, in England,  the theory of the social contract, and the foundations of the democratic constitutional republic in England and the United States. We will explore legal reason and contemporary theories of how it should be used to analyze and decide cases justly and to further the common good.  If time permits, we may summarize and analyze great constitutional issues as presented in the earliest landmark Supreme Court cases of Chief Justice Marshall. Mutually exclusive with PHIL 373.

    "description" : "Modern computer systems are designed and implemented in a layered fashion, wherein each layer builds upon those beneath it, providing abstractions for processing, memory, and I/O that are progressively more abstracted from the hardware and easier to use than those of the underlying layers.  While this layered architecture has made building systems easier, it has also made understanding their behavior and performance more difficult. Every layer from the managed run-time environments used by modern programming languages to the hypervisor play a role in processor scheduling, memory management, and I/O, making it oftentimes difficult to pinpoint which layer of the system is interacting poorly with a program.  This class will teach students about the fundamental characteristics of the abstractions for processing, memory, and I/O at each layer of a modern computer system, so that they might understand the functionality provided by each layer, and instruct them on the use of modern debugging, profiling, and tracing tools, so that they are equipped to characterize the behavior and performance of their programs. In order to enroll in an online section of this course, you are expected to have a working camera and microphone.  During class sessions, you must be able to participate using your microphone and you are expected to have your camera on for the duration of the class so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class, just as you would be in an in-person class.",

By surveying and learning about the different type of EML approaches, this course outlines a framework for engineering professionals to progress from engineering manager to engineering executive (e.g., Vice President of Engineering, Chief Technology Officer). Practical methods from the engineering management literature that addresses technology-based innovation issues that have engineering management implications will be introduced. Seminal technology management principles, such as disruptive innovation, leaderless technology development, and digital platform strategy, found in companies ranging in size from start-up to large, will be examined. \n\nIn order to enroll in an online section of this course, you are expected to have a working camera and microphone.  During class sessions, you must be able to participate using your microphone and you are expected to have your camera on for the duration of the class so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class, just as you would be in an in person class.",

    "description" : "Taught in the fall, Introduction to Literary Editing & Publishing is the first course in a recommended two-part sequence that explores literary publishing and the diversity of professionals in that space: editors, agents, publishers, and writers. Students enrolled in ENGL 113 will consider the fundamental questions of the industry: “What is literature and who decides?”, What is craft?”, “What is poetry and what is the utility of a poem?”, “What stories are fiction writers allowed to tell?”, and “What is creative nonfiction’s relationship to truth?” Alongside these discussions, students will study the basic elements of literature’s three main genres (poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction), enlarge their understanding of editorial critique, and develop skills for providing feedback in the workshop setting. Several classes throughout the semester will feature discussions with visiting publishers, editors, agents, poets, essayists, and/or novelists. Students will also be asked to become practitioners of “literary citizenship.” This will come about through weekly attendance at staff meetings of The Rice Review, participation in literary events throughout Houston, and through the hands-on experience of planning and hosting The Rice Review’s annual Fall Open Mic Night. All students will be considered as official staffers for the magazine and will be acknowledged in that year’s annual issue. Course counts toward the English Creative Writing Major Concentration (ECRW). There is no prerequisite for this course, but a joy for reading and debating the qualities of great poetry and prose is strongly encouraged. ENGL 113 is a prerequisite for ENGL 114. For more information about the spring continuation of the course and the production of The Rice Review, please refer to the course description for ENGL 114.",

By studying an array of transcontinental case studies, we will deepen our understanding of how individuals and communities alike mobilize collective, creative actions to protect and conserve local environments in the face of daunting ecological oppression. We will moreover collectively explore how conservation has been used as an oppressive tool to further advance capitalist and statist policies and agendas in a global context. In doing so, this course will draw our attention to the contested, varied, unequal, and changing political and capitalist agendas and contexts in which conservation programs and policies are often conceived and implemented.

In this course, we will learn both the analytical techniques and also complementary numerical methods. For the latter part, programming literacy is essential. This requires gaining proficiency in (1) the programming language, an aspect that involves learning the grammar and the syntax of the language, and (2) computational thinking, an aspect that is independent of the programming language and is a skill that is broadly applicable to all problem solving and analysis. We will study all these aspects with applications in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. If registering for CHBE 302, you must register for CHBE 301.",

However, the matrices of technical and user related decision paths that engineering leaders make to guide the team are not always constrained by ethics in a formal way. This course will help students understand the impact of ethics on engineering and technology in order to apply ethics concepts to decision making on issues that emerge in the workplace during one’s career.\n\nIn order to enroll in an online section of this course, you are expected to have a working camera and microphone.  During class sessions, you must be able to participate using your microphone and you are expected to have your camera on for the duration of the class so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class, just as you would be in an in person class.",

Thus, it should come as little surprise that institutional skepticism is on the rise, including increasingly negative public perception of higher education. Is academia doomed to wither away from its metaphorical ivory tower—or do academics occupy one of the last remaining spaces where alternative visions of the world are still possible?\nBy analyzing one scholarly reading each week, this discussion-based course will examine the role academia can—or can’t—play in activist efforts to develop and implement political re-imaginings. Through critical dialogue exploring theoretical and material social/political/economic issues, we will arrive at answers to our essential question, “how can academia help us challenge oppression and create a more just world?”\"",

When choosing to include these works in their repertoire, performers often need to develop new skills which are not typically included in their training. Performers may be faced with many questions about interactive software, hardware, cables, microphones, loudspeakers, digital files, lighting, and more. This class is designed to provide hands on experience so that performers can approach this area with more confidence while also giving them an opportunity to learn and perform with technology. In the class, students will choose and learn a contemporary, technology-assisted piece that will be workshopped in class sessions and later presented to the public in a live performance.",

Today, robots are built for applications as diverse as exploring remote planets, de-mining war zones, cleaning toxic waste, assembling cars, inspecting pipes in industrial plants and mowing lawns. Robots are also interacting with humans in a variety of ways: robots are museum guides, robots assist surgeon sin life threatening operations, and robotic cars can drive us around. The field of robotics studies not only the design of new mechanisms but also the development of artificial intelligence frameworks to make these mechanism useful in the physical world, integrating computer science, engineering, mathematics and more recently biology and sociology, in a unique way. This class will present fundamental algorithmic advances that enable today’s robots to move in real environments and plan their actions. It will also explore fundamentals of the field of Artificial Intelligence through the prism of robotics. The class involves a significant programming project.

    "description" : "\"Role-playing video games, frequently shortened to role-playing games (RPGs), are a genre of video games, where the player interacts directly with the world, usually gaining character development in terms of recording statistics. The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction, drawing from fantasy and sci-fiction to inhabit worlds that suspend standard understandings of reality. More than other genres, RPGs rely on a combination of gameplay mechanics, cutscenes, and user interface to develop well-defined stories and settings that drive the complex negotiation between the player and the game. Building on this, how do RPGs integrate interactive gameplay and narrative elements to create an effective story?\nIn this course, we will explore elements of role-playing games (abilities, items, combat, cutscenes, setting) through the lenses of narrative (character development, worldbuilding, plot) with an intersectional framework that attends to culture, gender, sexuality, and disability simultaneously. We will be thinking about how RPGs serve as a site of speculative possibility for experimental and unconventional stories. During class, we will discuss popular RPGs such as Chrono Trigger and Legend of Zelda, as well as less known titles like Okami and Ib, walking through gameplay footage and cutscenes to eventually apply their understanding in a final project, where students get the opportunity to work in teams to either submit their own game design proposal or write a short analytical paper on a RPG of their choice.\"",

    "description" : "This course will be dedicated to problems and topics occurring in the energy industry, both in R&D and in operations. It has three main components:\n1.\tComputational Geophysics\n2.\tReservoir Simulation Fundamentals\n3.\tMachine Learning\nThe first two components will be taught together in the first 10 weeks by dedicating half of the class-time to each subject. The Machine Learning component will, in part, build on the first two fundamental components and will be taught using the full class time.\nComputational Geophysics\nThe participants in this geophysics part of the course are expected to be interested into learn how to use modern seismic data to image the subsurface with awareness of the computational costs of the techniques involved. The main focus will be given to current seismic imaging tools including cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) applications. As the result of the successful completion of this course part, the course participants should be able to: (1) Understand the context and value of imaging tools for the hydrocarbon exploration business. (2) Relate the imaging tools with their computational costs for modern computer resources. (3) Properly use wave-based geophysical imaging and ML-based tools and (4) Understand main seismic processing and interpretation decisions.\nApplied Reservoir Simulation\nThis component of the course will introduce participants to the practice of reservoir simulation. This class will be an applied course on reservoir simulation. Theoretical descriptions will be provided as warranted but will be kept to minimum. Class participants will learn about the fundamentals of applied reservoir simulation, use of a reservoir simulator, and how to select the proper model for a simulation study. This course will also cover data preparation, grid design, calibration of the reservoir model, forecasting of future performance, and interpretation of simulation results. Participants will also be introduced to the role of simulation in reservoir management, limitations of reservoir simulation, and the structural aspects of the models. Upscaling and recent advances simulation techniques will also be discussed. A realistic open-source reservoir simulation software will be used during the tutorials and computer projects.\nMachine Learning for Oil & Gas\nThis part of the course will introduce the fundamentals of statistical learning, present a few of the popular learning paradigms and algorithms, and culminate in a small student project applying them to an oil reservoir data set using the R programming language (solutions to class problems will be accepted in any programming language or system). Much of the material presented here is also known under the names “Big Data”, “Data Analytics”, “Artificial Intelligence”, “Data Mining”, “Petroleum Data Driven Analytics” and other terms. Weeks 11 and 12 are theory only, weeks 13-15 will have small hands-on exercises incorporated and week 16 and 17 are dedicated to solving a simple oil reservoir problem using machine learning.",

We also examine energy from the perspective of states, whether the big exporters like Russia and the Middle East, demand centers in Asia and Europe, or underdeveloped countries in Latin America and Africa seeking to leverage domestic reserves for export revenues and domestic development. Students will use academic theory and case discussion to highlight energy business challenges in countries with diverse political systems and wide-ranging levels of economic development.",

Lectures will be focused on case studies and examples of startups that relate to certain stages in the journey of a startup, but students will be required to develop their own idea for a company and present.

    "description" : "As healthcare costs continue to rise at an alarming rate in U.S. over the past decade (about 20% of GDP by some accounts), issues relating cost measurement and management in the delivery of healthcare have also taken center stage. Experts in business and management have argued that extant cost systems do a poor job of measuring how much it costs to treat patients. Absent accurate measurement of these costs, many decisions could go wrong.  Cost management and efficiency initiatives would be misguided, and medical reimbursements would lack proper cost bases. These concerns have triggered advances in cost measurement and management techniques that are useful not just in the healthcare setting, but also in other service organizations. The purpose of this elective is to help students develop a critical understanding of the nature of costs in healthcare delivery, their measurement in a variety of decision contexts, and how they can be managed and improved. Students will be exposed to tools such as the break-even analysis, role of cost allocations, activity-based costing, time-driven activity based costing, and cost control.",

This movement, known as the Jewish Diaspora, led to the development of numerous ethnic divisions within the Jewish culture, such as the Ashkenazi, the Sephardic, and more. The global migration of the Jewish people has led to separate religious practices and cultural diversity within the religion. However, holiday celebrations have served as a bridge to unite Jews from different backgrounds through shared rituals, prayer, and, most importantly, food. Therefore, throughout this class, students will examine: why does food play such a central role in Jewish holidays? To investigate this, students will learn about the historical background and symbolism behind classic Jewish holiday cuisine. At the end of each lecture, students will participate in a Kahoot quiz to test their knowledge of the historical significance and symbolism of each holiday and its food. The following week, everyone will participate in a hands-on cooking tutorial based on the previous in-class lecture, allowing students to foster their interest and appreciation for unfamiliar cultures. At the end of the course, students will be expected to prepare a traditional Jewish holiday food of their choice and examine how food impacts their own holiday celebrations.",

Watching minions chatter to one another is fun, but sometimes we may wonder what linguistic merit fictional languages actually have. However, not all of these fictional languages are so “fictional” — oftentimes, they have real grammar, vocabulary, and phonology patterns that are more sophisticated than expected. In what ways can these fictional languages and their structures reflect the real world languages that we speak everyday? In this course, students will analyze a different fictional language each week, followed by a chance for them to apply their new skills in a semester-long project to construct their own fictional language with the rest of the class. Students will learn how to spot linguistic patterns that apply to a broader context, ultimately aiding them in their ability to learn any type of language. The course culminates in an oral exam, where students will have the opportunity to speak to each other in the constructed language that they built together.",

However, a psychedelic rock band from the late 1960s defied the status quo and created a community. Through thought-provoking lyrics and improvisational music, the Grateful Dead were\na cultural phenomena. Inspired by their time on the road, the band wrote mystical songs filled with allusion and symbolism. More importantly, the Grateful Dead played music that deeply resonated with their fans’ emotions. In this course, students will analyze Grateful Dead lyrics and learn about their lifestyle. A deep dive into the lyrics shows the range of the human experience and how a traveling band lived. Analysis of the Grateful Dead will help students answer the question: Why do certain lyrical and musical strategies cause people to react in different ways? Every class, students will\nparticipate in group discussions about different song interpretations and connect the songs to what was happening in the band at the time. There will be a final paper where students analyze a song, describe the allusions, and elaborate on their reaction to the song.\"",

Who are the artists, curators, scholars, and theorists who have asked and answered this question over the decades? Is a Black aesthetic inherently revolutionary and interested in the political lives of black people and their liberation? Or is a Black aesthetic best exemplified by the manipulation of materials, visual composition, and saturation? Or both? We will engage theories of black art and aesthetics that emerged in the 1920s through today to take seriously the question: how does the visual life of blackness matter? In this class we will break through the traditional rhetoric of diversity and representation and discuss how artists over the decades have insisted instead on redistributions of power, radical and speculative material practices, and structural change. It is my priority to make this course on black aesthetics joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities.",

Robots are also interacting with humans in a variety of ways: robots are museum guides, robots assist surgeon sin life threatening operations, and robotic cars can drive us around. The field of robotics studies not only the design of new mechanisms but also the development of artificial intelligence frameworks to make these mechanism useful in the physical world, integrating computer science, engineering, mathematics and more recently biology and sociology, in a unique way. This class will present fundamental algorithmic advances that enable today’s robots to move in real environments and plan their actions. It will also explore fundamentals of the field of Artificial Intelligence through the prism of robotics. The class involves a significant programming project.

Perhaps you’ll donate life-saving organs and tissues if denoted by your driver’s license. Perhaps you’ll even nourish a tree. Whatever happens, the fate of a post-mortem body is little talked about and often ignored until we’re faced with the death of someone we know. In the United States, traditional burial and cremation are the two most common options for body disposition. Recently, newer and more environmentally friendly options, such as water cremation and human composting, have been introduced. Yet these are rarely available or legal in only a few states. How should American society determine what happens to its dead?\nThis course will discuss everything that may happen to a body after death, from decomposition to body disposition to organ donations. Students will learn the history and reasons behind the legalization and practice of body disposition methods. They will analyze what makes treatment of the dead body respectful or vilified in the United States. With no exams in this course, students will complete projects which include researching a funeral option from another culture and writing a letter to a state representative. \"",

Through a series of tutorial lectures, students will acquire familiarity with cutting-edge research topics in various subfields of applied physics, including quantum information engineering, low-dimensional materials, ultracold atoms, nanophotonics, plasmonics and metamaterials, and neuroengineering. Furthermore, students will gain hands-on research experience in trial projects provided by different laboratories in APP through mini-rotations (3 weeks per laboratory). The primary goal of this course is to assist first-year APP students to find Ph.D. advisors by the end of the fall semester so they can start Ph.D. research in the spring semester. Additionally, this course aims to provide first-year APP students with an opportunity to develop a genuine camaraderie within the cohort by spending time together. Furthermore, each first-year student will be mentored by a senior APP student throughout the semester to get fully integrated into the program and the Rice community.  Recommended Prerequisite(s): Understanding of undergraduate-level classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, and solid-state physics",

Will see quantum algorithms, such as Deutch-Josza algorithms, Simon’s algorithm, Shor’s algorithms, Grover’s search, Watrous’s rewinding algorithms, Hamiltonian simulation algorithms, HHL algorithms, Block-encoding and singular value transformation, and more. 3) What’s the limit of quantum algorithms? We will see some techniques to prove the limits of quantum algorithms on specific problems, such as polynomial methods and the compressed oracle method. 4) Brainstorming together. Students need to select some research papers to present to me, and we will have some group discussions on related topics.  Recommended Prerequisite(s): COMP 414 and COMP 487 Repeatable for Credit.",

In December of 2017, a virus-based gene therapy drug was approved by the FDA, making it the first of its kind for the treatment of an inherited disease. This landmark achievement is just the beginning of a new era of human therapeutics. This class will discuss the gene therapy field – where it was and where it is now. Clinically important vectors currently under human testing, and opportunities for the next generation of improved gene delivery vectors will be presented. The biological and physiological barriers to efficient gene delivery will be investigated in order to spur new ideas for improving vector efficiency and specificity. Cross-list: BIOE 422.

In this class, students will have the opportunity to interact with visual and performance artists. We will take field trips into the studio spaces of Houston-based artists in order to ask questions about who they cite and why. Additionally, we will discuss how those citations of radical Black thought are visible within their art-making. Over the course of the semester, we will pair black contemporary artists with core readings in black studies and underline citational practices between the fields of Black studies and art history. Through this unique case-study-based pairing, students will learn about the methods, materials, and theoretical throughlines within the work of formative visual and performance artists while also becoming familiar with different concepts within the interdisciplinary field of black studies.",

Beginning with the bulk composition of planetary bodies, and an overview of the chemical and petrologic properties of the rocks that make up each of these reservoirs, the basic principles of petrology and geochemistry will be presented in the context of the rock cycle, plate tectonics, as well as the origin of economically and societally important ore deposits. Some basic concepts as to how the whole planet scale processes influence the chemistry of surface environment of Earth will be also be introduced. A laboratory and field trip, where students will see petrologic and geochemical principles applied, will be required.

This course is organized around fundamental frameworks to assist you in analyzing a wide range of strategic issues facing a firm. It will: 1) Cover theories for in-depth industry analysis, for anticipating and predicting future industry developments; 2) Examine some of the firm specific underpinnings of competitive advantage and growth in both domestic and international settings; 3) Explore some of the challenges in implementing the strategy that has been formulated. Nevertheless, the best analysis in the world will have little effect if it cannot be communicated to others. Managers must be able to articulate their views coherently and persuasively, and they must be skilled at understanding and critiquing other points of view. Management is a \"verbal sport;\" perhaps 90% of a typical manager's day is consumed by oral communication. Time is often scarce. You must learn to make convincing arguments and to make them quickly, or the merits of your ideas are likely to become simply irrelevant. This skill takes practice, and we will place a great deal of emphasis on it in class.",

    "description" : "This course provides a rigorous introduction to linear optimization with continuous and integral variables. We explore the theory and algorithms of linear and integer programming. Topics studied in the linear programming part include polyhedral theory, duality, and algorithms for solving linear programs. Building on linear programming, the second part of this course studies linear optimization with integral variables. Here, the topics covered are integral polyhedra and perfect formulations, including TU matrices and TDI systems. We culminate with exact methodologies for integer programming, including branch-and-bound and cutting-plane techniques. This course provides the foundations for further studies in convex optimization, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic programming. Cross-list: CMOR 541.

Amid both utopian and dystopian visions for the potential of AI, important questions about the role of “artificial” intelligence in “human” society are newly emerging or being considered anew: what kinds of sociotechnical processes count as “AI”? What will be the moral status of “autonomous” entities? What will be the social, cultural, and political impact of AI? What will this impact be in different cultures and nations around the world? In this class, we will draw on a diverse set of historical and theoretical materials - including academic texts, historical analyses, technical reports, and science fiction film and literature - to examine the affordances and limitations of AI in areas such as labor, healthcare, and criminal justice, and on software such as videogames, social media platforms, and virtual reality.

How can an understanding of mathematics help us create art with purpose and pattern? And how can these mathematical patterns be incorporated into clothing design, of all things? \nIn this course, students will visualize and utilize mathematical patterns through crochet garment design – from understanding the relationship between hook size and garment gauge, to crocheting flat, simple shapes and panels that can be assembled into fully wearable clothes. This class will explore crochet fashion through a mathematical lens, using geometry to understand how to assemble 2D shapes such as perfect circles and squares. Students will be taught the basics of crochet, understand how combinations of the six most common crochet stitches can form complex and sophisticated motifs, and be able to produce their own unique crochet patterns by the end of this course (including a pattern for a 6x6” square). Students are not expected nor assumed to have any crochet or math background prior to this course.\"",

However, the management of innovation is inherently difficult and risky because customer demand and preferences change quickly and technological changes are highly unpredictable and thus most new products and technologies are not a commercial success. This course is designed to help executives apply the key strategic management frameworks and concepts to address important challenges they face in innovation management: How to manage market uncertainty, technological uncertainty and competitive volatility? what are the enemies of innovation in both new ventures and successful established firms? How to build strategic alliances for technology/product innovation? And how to manage innovation in the global market?",

Today, robots are built for applications as diverse as exploring remote planets, de-mining war zones, cleaning toxic waste, assembling cars, inspecting pipes in industrial plants and mowing lawns. Robots are also interacting with humans in a variety of ways: robots are museum guides, robots assist surgeon sin life threatening operations, and robotic cars can drive us around. The field of robotics studies not only the design of new mechanisms but also the development of artificial intelligence frameworks to make these mechanism useful in the physical world, integrating computer science, engineering, mathematics and more recently biology and sociology, in a unique way. This class will present fundamental algorithmic advances that enable today’s robots to move in real environments and plan their actions. It will also explore fundamentals of the field of Artificial Intelligence through the prism of robotics. The class involves a significant programming project.

    "description" : "\"Hailed as the \"\"Songwriter of the Decade\"\", Taylor Swift has been at the forefront of pop culture for years, making her an enduring presence in a fast-paced industry. The name itself brings both appeal and aversions, yet what really shines about the star is her songwriting. Through close readings of her music, alongside considerations of her public discourse, this class will be a seminar discussing the nuances of her lyrics. Using a chronological approach, this course will spend time on each one of her ten albums. We'll consider a broad range of topics, including: femininity and gender; social media and public opinion; politics and social impact; fiction and nonfiction; American nationalism and whiteness; and finally, family and feuds. \nWe therefore aim to answer the question: What does Taylor Swift’s songwriting evolution say about her own personal growth surrounding public discourse? Instruction will be provided in lecture, discussion, and audiovisual formats. Knowledge will be evaluated with short written responses, participation in class discussions, and a final essay analyzing a song of your choosing.\"",

Today, robots are built for applications as diverse as exploring remote planets, de-mining war zones, cleaning toxic waste, assembling cars, inspecting pipes in industrial plants and mowing lawns. Robots are also interacting with humans in a variety of ways: robots are museum guides, robots assist surgeon sin life threatening operations, and robotic cars can drive us around. The field of robotics studies not only the design of new mechanisms but also the development of artificial intelligence frameworks to make these mechanism useful in the physical world, integrating computer science, engineering, mathematics and more recently biology and sociology, in a unique way. This class will present fundamental algorithmic advances that enable today’s robots to move in real environments and plan their actions. It will also explore fundamentals of the field of Artificial Intelligence through the prism of robotics. The class involves a significant programming project.
