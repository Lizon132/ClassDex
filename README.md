# ClassDex
By Adam, Chris, Michel, and Valerie

# DESCRIPTION
ClassDex is a automation applicaiton to make picking classes easier and more efficient. In this applicaiton students pick classes based upon weighted criteria picked by the user. 
Students select a set of classes that are identified as required or optional. They are then placed in ranked order from most preferred to least prefered. 
This data is then passed through an algorithm which then returns a rudimentary class schedule.

# Main Repo

The main repo contains most of the front end work done on the project. HTML, CSS, and images. These templates were then implated with typescript to interface with our data.

# CHALLENGES

Getting the Data

Getting the initial data set was one of the earliest problems with this project. We built a script that would scrape the data from the Rice University website that would return a list of all classes, their class codes, professor, dates and times, and course description.
